Attempting to upsell the user on other products and features is acceptable within limits.

a) Upsell notifications should not be overly prominent or annoying.
b) Plugins may not contain functionality that is crippled or locked, only to be unlockable by payment or upgrade. Paid functionality must be part of an externally hosted service or a separate plugin, that is not hosted on wordpress.org.
c) Plugins may not disable included functionality after a trial period or quota.
