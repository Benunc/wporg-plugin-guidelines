# WordPress.org Plugin Repository Guidelines

This is the online repository for the proposed revamp of the WordPress.org Plugin Guidelines.

## Introduction

The plugin review team has already gone through and made serious renovations in order to clarify intent and meaning.

## Table of Contents
0. [Introduction]()
1. [Plugins must be compatible with the GNU General Public License v2, or any later version.]()
2. Include a license in your plugin with a license.txt file. 
3. A stable version of your plugin must be available from your WordPress.org repository page. 
4. Keep your code (mostly) human readable. 
5. Trialware is not allowed in the repository. 
6. Serviceware is permitted in the repository. 
7. The plugin may not “phone home” or track users without their informed, explicit, opt-in consent. 
8. The plugin may not send executable code via third-party systems. 
9. The plugin and its developers must not do anything illegal, dishonest, or morally offensive.
10. The plugin must not embed external links on the public site (like a “powered by” link) without explicitly asking the user’s permission. 
11. The plugin should not hijack the blog admin.
12. Public facing pages on WordPress.org may not contain “sponsored” or “affiliate” links or third party ads. 
13. The plugin page in the directory should include no more than 12 tags.

17. Respect trademarks.
18. We reserve the right to alter the Plugin Guidelines at any time with or without notice.

## Feedback

If you feel a guideline’s explanation is unclear, please create an issue with what you feel should be changed and why. All grammar/spelling corrections are greatly welcome. We’re trying to write these for all levels of developers, as well as people who may not speak English proficiently. Using words like ‘obsequious’ should be avoided (nb: That’s mostly to Mika who uses those words regularly).

All feedback should be opened as [issues](https://github.com/Ipstenu/wporg-plugin-guidelines) in the tracker.
